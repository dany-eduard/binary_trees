# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
#### What is a binary tree
#### What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
#### What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
#### What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
#### What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
#### What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
